Assessment for Smart Dubai

About the Project
----
This Project is built with MVVM Architecture and without any dependancy or third party libraries and included tests also.
This Project has customizable custom cells and most of the UI components customized programtically. 

This Project has an API Client which is listing all the API calls in one place and it helps to call the api from view controllers with couple of lines code to make it clean.

Url Directory is listing all api's and url constructs

ViewModels interecting with the models to load and display the data to view and handling some other logics as well.

Helpers groups Containing Color extensions, image loading extensions and constants (which is handling all the titles, identifier strings, cell strings and etc)

Even though I have great knowladge on cocapods and carthage for external library usage I didn't use any libraries or unwanted features to this app to make sure built natively with apple's sdk.
